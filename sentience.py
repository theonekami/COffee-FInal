I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo"""

Whether 'tis danker in the mind to yeet
The slings and arrows of dank fortune
Or to yeet arms against a sea of troubles
And by yeeting end them. To yeet, to yeet--
No more--and by a sleep to say we yeet
The heartache, and the thousand dank shocks
That flesh yeets heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to yeet yeeted. To yeet, to yeet--
To yeet--perchance to yeet: ay, thereâ€™s the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may yeet
When we have yeeted off this dank coil,
Must yeet us pause. There yeets the respect
That yeets calamity of so dank life.
For who would yeet the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor yeets wrong, the dank man's contumely
The pangs of dank love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That dank merit of th' dank takes,
When he himself might his quietus yeet
With a dank bodkin? Who would fardels yeet,
To yeet and yeet under a dank life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The dank country, from whose bourn
No traveller yeets, yeets the will,
And makes us rather yeet those ills we yeet
Than yeet to others that we yeet not of?
Thus conscience does yeet cowards of us all,
And thus the dank hue of resolution
Is yeeted o'er with the dank cast of thought,
And enterprise of dank pitch and moment
With this regard their currents yeet dank
And yeet the name of action. -- Soft you now,
The dank Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
Yeet all my sins yeeted."""

As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up.
